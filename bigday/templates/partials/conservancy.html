                We've reserved a block of rooms at this place -- (probably goint to be the turf valley resort?)
            </p>
            <p>We will provide a shuttle from the turf valley resort to the Howard County Conservancy.

                TODO maybe we should consider https://www.lyft.com/events instead?

                        The <a href="#todo">Hilton Garden Inn</a> is conveniently located just off the highway and very close to the wedding venue.
                        It is about a 20 minute drive to downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake.
                        We have a block of discounted rooms reserved there - use the code <code>LZW16</code> to get the group discount.
